    "you're working for a bank and you want to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan or not based on various factors like income, credit score, and so on. Here, you have a categorical outcome (default or no default), making logistic regression more appropriate because it deals with predicting probabilities and categories rather than exact numerical values. You're not interested in predicting an exact amount of default, but rather the likelihood of defaulting based on the given features. So, in this case, logistic regression would be the way to go."
